# LAB 7
In this lab, you'll get some practice with remotes by setting up a
GitHub account, forking a repository, and cloning it down to y our
system to work with.

## Get the calc2 project 
fork https://github.com/master-afip/calc2.git
```shell
git clone https://github.com/<my_github_account>/calc2.git 
# create another project
git clone https://github.com/<my_github_account>/calc2.git calc_other
# check the branch
cd  calc2.git
git branch -r 
git branch -av
git remote add upstream https://github.com/master-afip/calc2.git
git remote -v

```
